1. **Filtering by City**: The user can select one of the available cities (Chicago, New York City, Washington) to explore the bikeshare data for that city. 
2. **Filtering by Time**: Users can choose to filter the data by month, day, or both, or not at all. They can analyse data for specific months or days of the week. 
3. **Statistics**: The code provides the following statistics: 
- Most frequent times of travel (common month, common day of the week, common start hour)
- Most popular start and end stations for bikeshare trips. 
- Total travel time and mean travel time for bikeshare trips. 
- Counts of user types (subscriber, customer), and (if available) gender and birth year statistics.
4. **Raw Data Display**: Users have the option to view the raw data 5 rows at a time. 

### Files used
Files used for this project are csv files of Chicago, New York City, and Washington statistics on bikeshare, available from the Udacity course portal.
