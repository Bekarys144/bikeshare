### Date created
This project was created on 18 July 2023.

### How to Use
1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as 'pandas' and 'numpy'.
2. Download the bikeshare data files specified in the Files Used section, and place them in the same directory as this code. 
3. Run the code in your Python environment. 

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
1. **Filtering by City**: The user can select one of the available cities (Chicago, New York City, Washington) to explore the bikeshare data for that city. 
2. **Filtering by Time**: Users can choose to filter the data by month, day, or both, or not at all. They can analyse data for specific months or days of the week. 
3. **Statistics**: The code provides the following statistics: 
- Most frequent times of travel (common month, common day of the week, common start hour)
- Most popular start and end stations for bikeshare trips. 
- Total travel time and mean travel time for bikeshare trips. 
- Counts of user types (subscriber, customer), and (if available) gender and birth year statistics.
4. **Raw Data Display**: Users have the option to view the raw data 5 rows at a time. 

### Usage 
1. Run the code in your Python environment.
2. The code will prompt you to enter the city name (Chicago, New York City, or Washington) and whether you want to filter the data by month, day, both, or not at all.

3. If you choose to filter by month, the code will prompt you to enter the month (January to June).

4. If you choose to filter by day, the code will prompt you to enter the day of the week (Monday to Sunday).

5. After applying the desired filters, the code will display statistics related to the bikeshare data in accordance with the chosen filters.

6. You will have the option to view 5 rows of the filtered data at a time and choose whether to restart the analysis or exit.

### Files used
Files used for this project are csv files of Chicago, New York City, and Washington statistics on bikeshare, available from the Udacity course portal.
